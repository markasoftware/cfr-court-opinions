* Mark Polyakov's eCFR analyzer
  A web tool to see interesting facts about the Code of Federal Regulations!

  This tool is hosted at https://markasoftware.com/cfr and runs with data from all 2024 court
  opinions. As you'll see below, it's possible (and beneficial!) to run it with more data, but it
  takes a long time to download and process 

  The most interesting part of this IMO is the ability to view how many US court opinions reference
  each document.
* Running locally
  This tool needs both the eCFR data and US court opinions PDFs. It analyzes US court opinions to
  search for mentions of CFRs.
